To ease the utilization of NUS IVLE

## Introduction ##

NUS IVLE is an essential tool for NUS students on daily basis. However, instead of leaving IVLE website opened in browser and check regularly for announcements, I prefer to have an add-on that will notify new announcements to me. Hence, I want to implement an add-on with related features for IVLE in Firefox.

## Features ##

  1. Announcement Notifier, IVLE Favicon Notifier
  1. Open IVLE in Sidebar
  1. Timetable and Event Reminders
  1. More to be added
